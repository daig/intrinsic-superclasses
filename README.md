# intrinsic-superclasses

A template haskell implementation of the [Intrinsic Superclasses Proposal](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/IntrinsicSuperclasses), which allows defining all typeclass methods at the "root" of the class heirarchy, rather than an instance declaration per class.

There are currently a number of limitations compared with the full language proposal (see: issues).

Functionality is added as-needed so drop an issue (and/or a pull request, if you're feeling ambitious ðŸ˜‰) if you have a use-case that isn't covered now.
